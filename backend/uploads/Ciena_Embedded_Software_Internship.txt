product idea
Camera + Mic Input
      ↓
[Pose Estimation + Facial Recognition]  ← (MediaPipe / DeepFace)
      ↓
[Audio Features + Tone Detection]      ← (openSMILE / Whisper)
      ↓
[Transcription + Structured Input Generation]
      ↓
[Gemini 1.5 Pro / LLM Analysis + Response Generation]
      ↓
[Text or Synthesized Voice Output to Candidate]
And for question generation -> look for current relevent information based on information provided by user such as field and resume and stuff?
pose and audio generate flags that we can feed into gemini ? like a json 
{
  "transcript": "...",
  "tone": "hesitant",
  "gaze": "avoiding eye contact",
  "expression": "nervous",
  "posture": "slouched"
}
i guess transcription should be started and stopped by if the space bar is held? like a push to talk type deal?
we sample tone every like 5 seconds like bunch it up so more precise feedback
